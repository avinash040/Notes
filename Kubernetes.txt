kubernetes

Pod: 
A pod is a kubernetes abstraction representing a group of one or more application containers(such as Docker)
The containers in a Pod share ip address space and port space

Node: 
A physical or a virtual worker machine. A pod always runs on a node  

Kubelet: 
A process reponsible for communication between kubernetes master and the node. It manages the pods and containsers on the machine.  


Troubleshooting commands: 

kubectl get - list resources
kubectl describe - show detailed information about a resource
kubectl logs - print the logs from a container in a pod
kubectl exec - execute a command on a container in a pod

Pods have lifecycle: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/

Service: 
Service routes traffic across a set of Pods. Services are the abstraction that allow pods to die and replicate in Kubernetes without impacting your application.
